        # there, and then just run a single version under
        # Windows and MacOS to make sure the code still works there.
        #
        # Windows: We can't efficiently run multiple Windows tests because
        # a GitHub Windows runner can only run a single version
        # of Python at a time and thus we don't get any
        # parallelism.
        #
        # MacOS: Our current self-hosted runner is very slow with little
        # memory and it would be prohibitive to run many versions. Also
        # Python 3.8-3.10 does not currently work on MacOS.
