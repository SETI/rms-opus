<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>OPUS (Outer Planets Unified Search) makes available more than 1,500,000
    images and spectra of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
    and the Kuiper Belt) from Voyagers 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons,
    and the Hubble Space Telescope. (More details about these missions and what
    OPUS provides can be found in the <b>About</b> section of the <b>Help</b>
    menu.)</p>

<p>OPUS makes it easy to perform four main tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Search</b> for observations (e.g. images and spectra) using a variety
        of simple and complex search terms.</li>
    <li><b>Browse</b> the results of the search using intuitive, colored
        thumbnails.</li>
    <li><b>Get Details</b> on individual observations.</li>
    <li><b>Download</b> PDS products (e.g. raw or calibrated data, preview
        images, geometry metadata) for off-line use.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four tasks correspond to the four navigation tabs at the top of the
OPUS screen. You can switch among these tabs in any order as you explore the
data OPUS has to offer.</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>The <b>Search</b> tab consists of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A series of <em>search terms</em> on the left side organized by
        category. By default, there are five categories:
        <ol>
            <li><b>General Constraints</b> includes high-level information such
                as the mission, instrument, and target name.</li>
            <li><b>PDS Constraints</b> includes search fields more internal to
                the PDS, such as the Volume ID and Data Set ID. These fields
                are less likely to be useful to the casual user.</li>
            <li><b>Image Constraints</b> permits easy searching across missions
                and instruments by abstracting away details about the physical
                details of the observation, such as image size and exposure
                time.</li>
            <li><b>Wavelength Constraints</b> permits easy searching across
                missions and instruments by abstracting away details about what
                portion of the electromagnetic spectrum the observation
                encodes, such as wavelength range and polarization.</li>
            <li><b>Surface Geometry Constraints</b> allows searching on the
                details of any body in the field of view, such as latitude and
                longitude or lighting geometry.</li>
            <li><b>Ring Geometry Constraints</b> allows searching on the details
                of any planetary rings in the field of view, such as radius
                and longitude or lighting geometry.</li>
        </ol>

        In addition, new categories will appear when the search is sufficiently
        restricted. For example, when all observations in the current search
        are from Cassini, a <b>Cassini Constraints</b> category will appear
        with Cassini-specific search fields.</li>
    <li>A series of <em>search fields</em> on the right side. When OPUS starts,
        <b>Planet</b> and <b>Intended Target Name</b> are provided. Additional
        fields can be created by clicking on one of the search terms on the
        left. Search fields can be minimized by clicking on the
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i> icon,
        closed by clicking on the
        <i class="fa fa-times"></i> icon,
        or reordered by dragging and dropping the entire search field box.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are four basic types of search fields:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Multiple-Choice Fields</b> (such as <b>Planet</b> and <b>Mission</b>)
        allow you to select one or more items by clicking on a checkbox. If you
        select more than one item, your search will return results applicable
        to any of those items.</li>
    <li><b>String Fields</b> (such as <b>Volume ID</b>) allow you to search on
        strings. You can provide partial strings that match the beginning or
        end, are contained anywhere within, or match exactly, among
        other choices. As you type your search string you will be presented
        with suggestions; click on one of the suggestions to have it placed
        in the search field.</li>
    <li><b>Numeric Fields</b> (such as <b>Observation Duration</b> or
        <b>Observed Ring Radius</b>) allow you to search on a range of numbers
        by specifying either a minimum or a maximum value, or both. An
        explanation of the Any/All/Only dropdown menu is provided in the FAQ.
        </li>
    <li><b>Date/Time Fields</b> (such as <b>Observation Time</b>) allow you
        to search on a range of dates and times by specifying a minimum or
        maximum date/time, or both. You can enter dates and times in a wide
        variety of formats, although the standard is YYYY-MM-DD[Thh:mm:ss.sss].
        </li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter two types of fields, as you type your search value you will
    receive feedback indicating if the value is legal. A green box means it
    is fine as-is. A yellow box means the value is illegal and you should change
    something before leaving the search field (by clicking elsewhere or hitting
    the Enter key). If you leave the field with an invalid value, it will turn
    red and no search will be performed until you fix the value.</p>

<p>As you enter search values, the number of results that are selected will
    constantly update in the <b>Browse Results</b> tab. In addition,
    you will be provided with the minimum/maximum values or date/times,
    or the number of results for each multiple-choice item, based on your
    current search criteria.</p>

<p>Once you have selected entered some search constraints, it's time to browse
    the results.</p>

<h3>Browsing</h3>

<p>The <b>Browse Results</b> tab shows the observations selected by your search
    in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <b>Gallery View</b> shows a grid of colored thumbnails. The meaning
        of the thumbnail contents differs depending on the instrument, but in
        general it attempts to capture the image including filter color or
        wavelength range (for imaging cameras or spectrographs) or footprint
        (for non-imaging spectrographic instruments).</li>
    <li>The <b>Table View</b> shows a series of rows, one per observation,
        containing the currently selected metadata fields.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can switch between the two views by clicking on <b>View Table</b> or
    <b>View Gallery</b>.</p>

<p>You can navigate through the result set using the scrollbar on the right,
    which may be moved either up or down. As the scrollbar approaches one of its
    extremes, additional data will be loaded, giving the appearance of a
    continuous data set in either direction. You may also use the mouse wheel,
    up/down arrow keys, or page up/down keys. To move a larger distance through
    the result set, you may use the slider at the top of the screen. The
    observation number you select will appear in the top-left thumbnail
    (gallery) or top row (table).</p>

<p>Each observation has a menu (<i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i>) that allows
    you to perform a variety of operations, including adding or removing the
    observation from the cart, starting or ending a range of observations
    to be added or removed from the cart, showing the details of the
    observation, or downloading observation data. A single observation may also
    be added to or removed from the cart by using Ctrl+Click, clicking on the
    <i class="fas fa-cart-plus fa-xs"></i> or
    <i class="far fa-trash-alt fa-xs"></i> icons in the gallery view,
    or clicking on the checkbox in the table view. A range of observations may
    also be added to or removed from the cart by using Shift+Click to start and
    end the range. If the starting observation is not currently in the cart,
    all observations in the range will be added; if the starting observation is
    already in the cart, all observations in the range will be removed.
    See the section on the <b>Cart</b> tab below for more information on
    downloading.</p>

<p>The sort order for all results may be modified by clicking on a column header
    in the table view; this is the only way to choose a different metadata field
    to sort on. However, the current sort field and sort direction are always
    displayed at the top after the <i class="fas fa-random"></i> icon. Clicking
    a field name there will toggle the order between ascending and descending,
    and clicking on the <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> icon will remove
    that field from the sort order.</p>

<p>Clicking on a thumbnail or table row will display a larger version of the
    thumbnail along with the metadata for the currently selected metadata
    fields; this is called the slideshow view. You may navigate by clicking on
    the <i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i> or
    <i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> icons or using the right/left arrow
    keys. You may also add or remove observations from the cart or perform the
    operations permitted by the <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu.</p>

<p>Which metadata fields are displayed in the table view and slideshow view
    can be changed by clicking on <b>Select Metadata</b> at the top. Fields may
    be added or removed by clicking on them on the left, and may be reordered
    by dragging. The fields selected here also affect what is included in a
    CSV file when using <b>Download CSV (all results)</b> at the top or
    the <b>Download CSV of selected metadata</b> menu option, as well as what
    is included in downloaded data and URL archive zip files.</p>

<h3>The Cart</h3>

<p>The cart allows you to collect observations for future downloading. As
    described above, you can add or remove individual observations, or ranges
    of observations, from the <b>Browse Results</b> tab. The number of
    observations in the cart will be displayed next to the <b>Cart</b> tab.</p>

<p>The <b>Cart</b> tab allows you to view and navigate through your cart in the
    same way the <b>Browse</b> tab allows you to view and navigate through your
    total result set. In addition, the <b>Download Options</b> pane on the left
    shows the estimated total download size of your cart as well as which data
    products will be included in a download. The individual products can be
    selected or removed to reduce the file size.</p>

<p>Three basic methods of download are provided:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A <b>Metadata CSV</b> is a comma-separated value (CSV) text file
        containing one row per observation. The rows contain all of the
        metadata fields selected using the <b>Select Metadata</b> option. On
        the <b>Cart</b> tab, the <i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i><b>Metadata
        CSV</b> option will include all of the observations in your cart.
        On the <b>Browse</b> tab, the
        <i class="fas fa-download"></i><b>Download CSV (all results)</b>
        option will include <em>all</em> of the observations in your result set
        (which may be a lot!).
        The <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu may also be used to create
        a metadata CSV file for a single observation.</li>
    <li>A <b>Data Archive</b> includes all of the selected data products in
        a single zip file. Also included are a metadata CSV file, a file of
        product checksums, a manifest showing which files are included, and
        a file containing the URLs for each data product. On the <b>Cart</b>
        tab, the <i class="fas fa-download"></i><b>Data Archive</b> option will
        include all observations in your cart in the zip file. You may also
        download a data archive for all data relevant data products for a
        single observation using the
        <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu.</li>
    <li>A <b>URL Archive</b> is similar to a data archive, but includes only
        the non-product files (metadata CSV, checksum, manifest, and URL) in a
        single zip file. This results in a very small download. The actual data
        products can then be retrieved using a command line utility such as <b>wget</b>:
        <pre>    wget -i urls.txt</pre></li>
</ol>

<h3>Observation Details</h3>

<p>Finally, it is possible to view all of the available product files and all of
the available metadata for an observation by using the <b>Detail</b> tab.</p>

<p>To view an observation's details, you may click on a thumbnail's
    <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-xs"></i> icon or select <b>Show detail</b>
    in the <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu.</p>

<p>The <b>Detail</b> tab includes larger version of the thumbnail on the right.
    On the left is:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The OPUS ID you are viewing.</li>
    <li>Links to download a data archive or URL archive for the observation.
        </li>
    <li>A list of all available PDS product types for the observation, along
        with all files that are available for each. Multiple versions
        are offered if available. If an <b>Index</b> file has an active
        link, clicking on it will provide the full detail of the observation
        in the given index file.</li>
    <li>Metadata for the currently selected metadata fields, including the
        option to download a metadata CSV file for the observation.</li>
    <li>All available metadata for the observation, including the option to
        download it all in JSON format.</li>
</ol>
