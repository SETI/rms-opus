<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>OPUS (Outer Planets Unified Search) makes available more than 1,500,000
    images and spectra of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,
    and the Kuiper Belt) from Voyagers 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons,
    and the Hubble Space Telescope. (More details about these missions and what
    OPUS provides can be found in the <b>About</b> section of the <b>Help</b>
    menu.)</p>

<p>OPUS makes it easy to perform four main tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Search</b> for observations (e.g. images and spectra) using a variety
        of simple and complex search terms.</li>
    <li><b>Browse</b> the results of the search using intuitive, colored
        thumbnails.</li>
    <li><b>Get Details</b> on individual observations.</li>
    <li><b>Download</b> PDS products (e.g. raw or calibrated data, preview
        images, geometry metadata) for off-line use.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four tasks correspond to the four navigation tabs at the top of the
OPUS screen. You can switch among these tabs in any order as you explore the
data OPUS has to offer.</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>The <b>Search</b> tab consists of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A series of <em>search terms</em> on the left side organized by
        category. By default, there are six categories:
        <ol>
            <li><b>General Constraints</b> includes high-level information such
                as the mission, instrument, and target name.</li>
            <li><b>PDS Constraints</b> includes search fields more internal to
                the PDS, such as the Volume ID and Data Set ID. These fields
                are less likely to be useful to the casual user.</li>
            <li><b>Image Constraints</b> permits easy searching across missions
                and instruments by abstracting away details about the physical
                details of the observation, such as image size and exposure
                time.</li>
            <li><b>Wavelength Constraints</b> permits easy searching across
                missions and instruments by abstracting away details about what
                portion of the electromagnetic spectrum the observation
                encodes, such as wavelength range and polarization.</li>
            <li><b>Occultation or Reflectance Profiles Constraints</b> permits easy searching on
                the common attributes of both spacecraft-based and ground-based
                occultation profiles.</li>
            <li><b>Surface Geometry Constraints</b> allows searching on the
                details of any body in the field of view, such as latitude and
                longitude or lighting geometry.</li>
            <li><b>Ring Geometry Constraints</b> allows searching on the details
                of any planetary rings in the field of view, such as radius
                and longitude or lighting geometry.</li>
        </ol>

        In addition, new categories will appear when the search is sufficiently
        restricted. For example, when all observations in the current search
        are from Cassini, a <b>Cassini Constraints</b> category will appear
        with Cassini-specific search fields.</li>
    <li>A series of <em>search fields</em> on the right side. When OPUS starts,
        <b>Planet</b> and <b>Intended Target Name</b> are provided. Additional
        fields can be created by clicking on one of the search terms on the
        left. Search fields can be minimized by clicking on the
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i> icon,
        closed by clicking on the
        <i class="fa fa-times"></i> icon,
        or reordered by dragging and dropping the entire search field box.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are four basic types of search fields:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Multiple-Choice Fields</b> (such as <b>Planet</b> and <b>Mission</b>)
        allow you to select one or more items by clicking on a checkbox. If you
        select more than one item, your search will return results applicable
        to any of those items.</li>
    <li><b>String Fields</b> (such as <b>Volume ID</b>) allow you to search on
        strings. You can provide strings that match the beginning or
        end, match exactly, are (not) contained anywhere within, or match a
        <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp"
         target="_blank">regular expression</a>. As you type your search string
        you will be presented with suggestions; click on one of the suggestions
        to have it placed in the search field.</li>
    <li><b>Numeric Fields</b> (such as <b>Observation Duration</b> or
        <b>Observed Ring Radius</b>) allow you to search on a range of numbers
        by specifying either a minimum or a maximum value, or both. The
        <b>Observed Ring Radius</b> and <b>Wavelength</b> fields also allow you
        to type a ring or satellite name, or a color, respectively, into the
        minimum field. A dropdown box will give you a list of preprogrammed
        ranges for your convenience. Many numeric fields support selection of
        units. The default unit will be displayed in the search box title, but
        other units may be selected. Any values that have already been entered
        will automatically be converted to the newly select units. The
        <b>Any/All/Only</b> dropdown allows selection of how overlapping ranges
        are handled; a full explanation is available in the FAQ.
        </li>
    <li><b>Date/Time Fields</b> (such as <b>Observation Time</b>) allow you
        to search on a range of dates and times by specifying a minimum or
        maximum date/time, or both. You can enter dates and times in a wide
        variety of formats, although the standard is YYYY-MM-DD[Thh:mm:ss.sss].
        Once you finish entering a date/time, it will be reformatted into the
        standard format for you.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter three types of fields, as you type your search value you will
    receive feedback indicating if the value is legal. A green box means it
    is fine as-is. A yellow box means the value is illegal and you should change
    something before leaving the search field (by clicking elsewhere or hitting
    the Enter key). If you leave the field with an invalid value, it will turn
    red and no search will be performed until you fix the value.</p>

<p>For string, numeric, and date/time fields, you have the option of searching
    on multiple sets of values. You do this by clicking on the "+(OR)" button,
    which will add an additional set of input fields. The multiple input ranges
    are "OR"ed together. For example, if you search on emission angles between
    10 and 80 and also between 100 and 170, your results will contain
    observations that match either set of criteria. You can have up to 10 such
    ranges for each search field. All values must have the same units.</p>

<p>As you enter search values, the number of results that are selected will
    constantly update in the <b>Browse Results</b> tab. In addition,
    you will be provided (in green) in each search field with the
    minimum/maximum values or date/times, or the number of results for each
    multiple-choice item, based on your current search criteria.</p>

<p>The <b>Surface Geometry Target Selector</b> search field is special. Only one
    surface geometry target can be selected at a time. When you select a surface
    geometry target, a new <b>[Target] Surface Geometry Constraints</b>
    category will become available providing search fields for that single
    target. If you later change the surface geometry target, all of
    the existing target-specific fields you selected will automatically switch
    to the new target but keep their existing search values. This is useful
    for cases such as searching for similar lighting geometry for different
    targets. In addition, any metadata fields you selected for the previous
    target will be duplicated for the new target. If you close the
    <b>Surface Geometry Target Selector</b>, all target-specific search fields
    will also be closed.</p>

<p>Once you have entered some search constraints, it's time to browse the
    results.</p>

<h3>Browsing</h3>

<p>The <b>Browse Results</b> tab shows the observations selected by your search
    in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <b>Gallery View</b> shows a grid of colored thumbnails. The meaning
        of the thumbnail contents differs depending on the instrument, but in
        general it attempts to capture the image including filter color or
        wavelength range (for imaging cameras or spectrographs) or footprint
        (for non-imaging spectrographic instruments).</li>
    <li>The <b>Table View</b> shows a series of rows, one per observation,
        containing the currently selected metadata fields. The small thumbnail
        in each row can be expanded by hovering the mouse over it.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can switch between the two views by clicking on <b>View Table</b> or
    <b>View Gallery</b>.</p>

<p>You can navigate through the result set using the scrollbar on the right,
    which may be moved either up or down. As the scrollbar approaches one of its
    extremes, additional data will be loaded, giving the appearance of a
    continuous data set in either direction. You may also use the mouse wheel,
    up/down arrow keys, or page up/down keys. To move a larger distance through
    the result set, you may use the slider at the top of the screen. The
    observation number you select will appear in the top-left thumbnail
    (gallery) or top row (table).</p>

<p>Each observation has a menu (<i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i>) that allows
    you to perform a variety of operations, including adding or removing the
    observation from the cart, starting or ending a range of observations
    to be added or removed from the cart, adding all of the observations in the
    current search result set to the cart, showing the details of the
    observation, or downloading observation data. A single observation may also
    be added to or removed from the cart by using Ctrl+Click, clicking on the
    <i class="fas fa-cart-plus fa-xs"></i> or
    <i class="far fa-trash-alt fa-xs"></i> icons in the gallery view,
    or clicking on the checkbox in the table view. A range of observations may
    also be added to or removed from the cart by using Shift+Click to start and
    end the range. If the starting observation is not currently in the cart,
    all observations in the range will be added; if the starting observation is
    already in the cart, all observations in the range will be removed.
    In the table view, the <i class="fas fa-cart-plus fa-xs"></i> icon in the
    table header can also be used to add all observations in the current result
    set to the cart. See the section on the <b>Cart</b> tab below for more
    information on downloading the contents of the cart.</p>

<p>Results may be sorted in either ascending or descending order by one or more
    metadata fields. The current sort fields and their associated sort
    directions are always displayed at the top after the
    <i class="fas fa-random"></i> icon (the sort order must always include OPUS
    ID as the final field to ensure a deterministic ordering). The sort fields
    may be reordered by dragging the field name and the sort direction for a
    field may be changed by clicking on the field name. Sort fields may be
    added from the currently selected metadata fields by clicking
    <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>; to change the list of available fields use
    <b>Select Metadata</b>. A sort field may be removed by clicking its
    <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> icon. In the table view, if a column is
    being used to sort it will display the sort direction
    (<i class="fas fa-sort-up"></i> or <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i>) and a
    number in a circle showing its position in the sort order. Clicking on the
    header of a column that is used in the current sort will change the
    direction for that field. Clicking on the header of a column that is not
    currently being used will replace the current sort if there is only one
    field there (other than OPUS ID), or ask if you want to overwrite or append
    to the end of the current sort otherwise. Ctrl+clicking on a table header
    will always append that field to the end of the sort (but before OPUS ID).
    The same sort order applies to the <b>Browse</b> tab and the <b>Cart</b>
    tab.</p>

<p>Clicking on a gallery thumbnail or table row will display a larger version
    of the thumbnail along with the metadata for the currently selected metadata
    fields; this is called the slideshow view. You may navigate by clicking on
    the <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-left"></i> or
    <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i> icons or using the right/left arrow
    keys. You may also add or remove observations from the cart or perform the
    operations permitted by the <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu.</p>

<p>Which metadata fields are displayed in the table view and slideshow view
    can be changed by clicking on <b>Select Metadata</b> at the top. Fields may
    be added or removed by clicking on them on the left or removed by clicking
    on the <i class="far fa-trash-alt"></i> on the right, and may be reordered
    by dragging. Fields can also be added or removed in the table view by
    hovering over the column header; click on the <i class="far fa-trash-alt"></i>
    to remove a field or the <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> to add a new
    field before or after the column. The fields selected here also affect what
    is included in a CSV file when using <b>Download CSV (all results)</b> at the
    top or the <b>Download CSV of selected metadata</b> menu option, as well as
    what is included in downloaded CSV, data, and URL archive zip files available
    on the <b>Cart</b> tab. A button is available to conveniently create a CSV
    file directly from the <b>Select Metadata</b> dialog without having to
    save the selected fields first.</p>

<h3>The Cart</h3>

<p>The cart contains observations for future downloading. As described above,
    you can add or remove individual observations or ranges of observations
    from the <b>Browse Results</b> tab. The number of observations in the cart
    is displayed next to the <b>Cart</b> tab.</p>

<p>The <b>Cart</b> tab allows you to view and navigate through the cart in the
    same way the <b>Browse</b> tab allows you to view and navigate through the
    total result set. In addition, the <b>Download Data</b> pane on the left
    shows the estimated total download size of the cart as well as which data
    products will be included in a download. The individual products can be
    selected or removed to reduce the file size. If your browser is too narrow,
    the <b>Download Data</b> pane will not be visible until you press the
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-left"></i> <b>Download Data</b> button.
</p>

<p>While on the <b>Cart</b> tab, you move observations to the recycle bin
    rather than removing them from the cart entirely. These observations will
    be marked with <i class="fas fa-recycle text-success"></i>. You can then
    restore observations from the recycle bin to the cart. Observations may
    be moved to the recycle bin or restored to the cart as individual
    observations or as ranges of observations. In addition, all observations in
    the recycle bin can be moved to the cart at once by clicking on <b>Restore
    Recycle Bin to Cart</b>. All observations can be removed from the recycle
    bin by clicking on <b>Empty Recycle Bin</b>.</p>

<p>Observations in the recycle bin are not counted as part of the number
    displayed next to the <b>Cart</b> tab, nor will they be included in the
    downloaded data. The total number of observations currently in the recycle
    bin will be displayed next to the <b>Restore Recycle Bin to Cart</b>
    option.</p>

<p>Three basic methods of download are provided:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A <b>Data Archive</b> includes all of the selected data products in
        a single zip file. Also included are a metadata CSV file (data.csv),
        a manifest file (manifest.csv) showing which files are included along
        with their details (including checksums and sizes), and a file
        containing the URLs for each data product (urls.txt). On the
        <b>Cart</b> tab, the <i class="fas fa-download"></i>
        <b>Data Archive</b> button will produce a zip file containing all
        observations in the cart. You may also download a data archive of all
        relevant products for a single observation using the
        <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu.</li>
    <li>A <b>URL Archive</b> is similar to a data archive, but includes only
        the non-product files (metadata, manifest, and URLs) in a
        single zip file. This results in a very small download. The actual data
        products can then be retrieved using a command-line utility such as
        <b>wget</b>:
        <pre>    wget -i urls.txt</pre></li>
    <li>A <b>Metadata CSV</b> is a comma-separated value (CSV) text file
        containing one row per observation. The rows contain all of the
        metadata fields selected using the <b>Select Metadata</b> option. On
        the <b>Cart</b> tab, the <i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> <b>Metadata
        CSV</b> button will include all of the observations in the cart.
        On the <b>Browse</b> tab, the
        <i class="fas fa-download"></i> <b>Download CSV (all results)</b>
        option will include <em>all</em> of the observations in the result set
        (which may be a lot!).
        The <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu may also be used to create
        a metadata CSV file for a single observation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Observation Details</h3>

<p>Finally, it is possible to view all of the available product files and all of
the available metadata for an observation by using the <b>Detail</b> tab.</p>

<p>To view an observation's details, you may click on a thumbnail's
    <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-xs"></i> icon or select <b>Show detail</b>
    in the <i class="fas fa-bars fa-xs"></i> menu.</p>

<p>The <b>Detail</b> tab includes a larger version of the thumbnail on the
    right. On the left is:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The OPUS ID you are viewing.</li>
    <li>Links to download a data archive or URL archive for the observation.
        </li>
    <li>A list of all available PDS product types for the observation, along
        with all files that are available for each. Multiple versions
        are offered if available. If an <b>Index</b> file has an active
        link, clicking on it will provide the full detail of the observation
        in the given index file.</li>
    <li>Metadata for the currently selected metadata fields, including the
        option to download a metadata CSV file for the observation.</li>
    <li>All available metadata for the observation, including the option to
        download it all in JSON format. Each string or multiple-choice field
        has a <i class="fas fa-search"></i> icon after the value. If you click
        on this icon, a new browser tab will open with a new OPUS
        that searches only for that value for that search field. This is useful,
        for example, for easily finding other observations with the same
        Cassini <b>Observation Name</b> as the one you are currently looking
        at.</li>
</ol>
