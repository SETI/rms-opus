Edge-on solar hour angle is the longitude of the edge-on intercept point relative to the anti-solar direction. At 90 degrees, the ring particles are moving toward the Sun, whereas at 270 degrees they are moving away. Edge-on intercept geometry is optimized for describing observations of planetary rings obtained from viewpoints close to the ring plane. It employs cylindrical coordinates (radius, altitude, longitude), where radius values are measured from the ring rotation pole and altitude is normal to the ring plane. The intercept is defined as the point along a line of sight where that line is tangent to a cylinder with a particular radius. Edge-on intercept points that are obscured by the planet or a moon within the observed field of view are ignored. For observations capturing reflected sunlight (i.e., with wavelengths in the visual or near-infrared), intercept points that are shadowed by the planet are also ignored. This column tabulates the minimum value of the edge-on solar hour angle within the field of view of the observation. For fields of view that cross the midnight meridian, the tabulated minimum value will be greater than the maximum.",
